## Introduction
In this paper, we present SOFA, a novel two-stage framework designed to address the challenges of fine-grained unknown attack detection under the constraints of class imbalance and limited labeled attack samples. By introducing service triplet-based aggregation and combining one-class learning with meta-learning principles, SOFA achieves precise detection of both known and unknown attacks. At a high level, SOFA consists of four components named Service Aggregation, One-class Model Training, Fewshot-Learning, and Fine-Grained Detection.
